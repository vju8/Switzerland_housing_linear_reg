## Simple and Multiple Linear Regressions with Python scikit-learn

This project demonstrates the implementation of simple and multiple linear regression models using Python's scikit-learn library. It covers the following key components:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Loading and preparing data for regression analysis.
- **Simple Linear Regression:** Building and evaluating a model to predict a single dependent variable based on one independent variable.
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Extending the model to predict a single dependent variable based on multiple independent variables.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the regression models using metrics such as R-squared.
- **Visualization:** Plotting regression lines and residuals to understand model fit and prediction errors.
